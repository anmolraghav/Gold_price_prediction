# Gold Price Prediction
## Project Overview

This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict gold prices using historical data. The model is built using the logistic regression algorithm, and the dataset used is sourced from Kaggle.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast gold prices based on historical trends and patterns. By analyzing various market factors, the model aims to assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions regarding gold investments.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains various features related to gold prices. The dataset includes:

- `Date`
- `Gold Price`
- `Silver Price`
- `EUR/USD`
- `USO`
- `SPX`

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of data and identify any patterns or trends.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most significant features that impact gold prices.
4. **Modeling**: Use the logistic regression algorithm to build the predictive model.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and refine the model as necessary.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Derive insights from the model and suggest recommendations for investors and analysts.
